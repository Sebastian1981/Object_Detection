# Object_Detection
Object detection is used to locate and identify objects in images. AzureÂ´s "custom vision service" was used to train a model to recognize specific classes of objects in images.

## Get scripts running:
- set up a python 3.8 environment
- pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision==3.1.0
## Image Tagging and Model Training using the Custom Vision Tool
Images of three types of objects were uploaded to the custom vision ai tool for tagging and subsequent training.

Despite a small set of tagged images, the ai performs already very well with a recall of 93% and a precision of 100%.

## Testing the model on unseen Image
The image shown below was uploaded for inference to test the ai model.

As can be seen, the ai model detectes all three items with scores clearly above 90%. Also the objects locations seem very accurate.
